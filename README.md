# Intersection-observer-api

The Intersection Observer API is a JavaScript API that allows you to observe changes in the intersection of an element with an ancestor element or the viewport. This can be useful for implementing lazy loading of images, infinite scrolling, and other techniques to optimize the performance of web applications.

## Introduction

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or the viewport. It is especially useful for monitoring when an element enters or exits the viewport, making it a valuable tool for implementing various web performance optimizations.

## Basic Usage

To use the Intersection Observer API, you typically create an observer instance that watches one or more target elements. When the intersection of these elements with the viewport or a specified ancestor changes, a callback function is triggered.
